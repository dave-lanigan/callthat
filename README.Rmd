`callthat` is meant for `plumber` API developers who are wrapping their APIs inside an R package.  This package enables the testing of the API's endpoints within the `testthat` framework.  This allows the R Checks to also confirm that the endpoints still behave as expected.  The ultimate goal of `callthat` is to ensure for the package's automated testing confirms that the APIs still work even if the developer did not run the package's test locally.
