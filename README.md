`callthat` is meant for `plumber` API developers who plan to distribute
their APIs inside an R package. This package enables the testing of the
API’s endpoints within the `testthat` framework. This allows the R
Checks to also confirm that the endpoints still behave as expected. The
ultimate goal of `callthat` is to ensure for the package’s automated
testing confirms that the APIs still work even if the developer did not
run the package’s test locally.
